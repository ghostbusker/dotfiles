# dotfiles
because /r/unixporn makes me want to be a better person

Currently just a franken-install of first-page google results for "how to 1337 desktop"

#Usage: Burn the latest (lite) Raspbian img to a microSD card. Insert the card into a Raspberry Pi (4) and boot to the commandline. Connect to a network and download this project with the following command: "sudo git clone https://github.com/ghostbusker/dotfiles". Then use the following command to make the installer executable and run it: "cd dotfiles/ | sudo chmod +x dotfiles.sh | sudo ./dotfiles.sh". After this, the installer will run and you should be prompted a few times to continue.
